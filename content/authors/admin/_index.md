Howdy! I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science &
Engineering department, Texas A&M University, supervised by [Prof. Zhangyang
Wang](http://www.atlaswang.com). I also closely work with
[Prof. Wotao Yin](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/), in the Mathematics
department, UCLA. Prior to that, I obtained my B. S. degree from the School
of Gifted Young, [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)
(USTC), in 2017.

My research focuses on sparse optimization and deep learning, recently in
particular their analytical links and how that could help accelerate sparse
solvers in a data-driven fashion. Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf).

Currently I am working as a Ph.D. intern at Max Planck Institute for
Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, in collaboration with
[Dr. Krikmol Muandet](http://krikamol.org/) and
[Dr. Siyu Tang](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/stang).
