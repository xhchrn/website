Howdy! I am a Ph.D. student (since 2017) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (DICE), University of Texas at Austin.
I am a research assistant in the  **V**isual **I**nformatics Group @ University of **T**exas at **A**ustin ([VITA Group](https://vita-group.github.io/)), led by [Prof. Zhangyang Wang](https://www.atlaswang.com/).
Before I moved to UT Austin in Aug 2020, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, Texas A&M University.
I also closely work with [Prof. Wotao Yin](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/), in the Mathematics department, UCLA.
Prior to the start of my Ph.D. program, I obtained my B. S. degree from the School of Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn)), in 2017.

My research focuses on learn-to-optimize, meta-learning and efficient deep learning, and sparse neural networks, recently in particular the lottery ticket hypothesis and network analysis in neural networks.
Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf).

Recently I finished my research internship at Microsoft AI & Cloud, supervised by [Dr. Yu Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/chengyu05) and [Zhe Gan](https://zhegan27.github.io/).
